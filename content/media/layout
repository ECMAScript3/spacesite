some things:
	1. make a user data base
	2. make the website phone friendly(before making the other subpages)




home page:
    background with video playing in somewhat adjusted opacity and tinted slightly blue, video is about a a orbit around the earth.
    minimalist menu bar at top with a slightly tinted background and slight fade effect for when selecting buttons
    front page with header of what the project is about and some short links to different actions you can do the front page thing should have a background and
    when go into the page the stuff should slide from the side


news: 
    background is a static picture of the video with the same properties with some news on top of a slightly tinted block with low opacity
    text is to the right of pictures and stuff come from the closest side with the date on top of the article
    stuff is restricted to a one year span but scrolling down a bit more is permitted by a button press
contact:
    background is still the static picture with some links going to different people you can contact at the bottom with the social medias discord and other stuff is on the top
    if you click to contact a person then it brings up a page with the same layout before just with a box in the center with a bit more opacity telling you to enter email and such
    for getting in contact

dontate:
    background video is playing with some links you can click on for donating and telling the visitor what will be achived with that money.

about:
    just a scroll down type thing telling the visitor what we are about and looking good

balloon project:
    like the about page but just with the balloon instead as the main subject
