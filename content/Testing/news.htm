                            IN PLACING before the reader this unabridged translation of Adolf Hitler's book,
                            MEIN KAMPF, I feel it my duty to call attention to certain historical facts which must
                            be borne in mind if the reader would form a fair judgment of what is written in this
                            extraordinary work.
                            The first volume of MEIN KAMPF was written while the author was imprisoned in a
                            Bavarian fortress. How did he get there and why? The answer to that question is
                            important, because the book deals with the events which brought the author into this
                            plight and because he wrote under the emotional stress caused by the historical
                            happenings of the time. It was the hour of Germany's deepest humiliation, somewhat
                            parallel to that of a little over a century before, when Napoleon had dismembered the
                            old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germany.
                            In the beginning of 1923 the French invaded Germany, occupied the Ruhr district and
                            seized several German towns in the Rhineland. This was a flagrant breach of
                            international law and was protested against by every section of British political opinion
                            at that time. The Germans could not effectively defend themselves, as they had been
                            already disarmed under the provisions of the Versailles Treaty. To make the situation
                            more fraught with disaster for Germany, and therefore more appalling in its prospect,
                            the French carried on an intensive propaganda for the separation of the Rhineland from
                            the German Republic and the establishment of an independent Rhenania. Money was
                            poured out lavishly to bribe agitators to carry on this work, and some of the most
                            insidious elements of the German population became active in the pay of the invader.
                            At the same time a vigorous movement was being carried on in Bavaria for the
                            secession of that country and the establishment of an independent Catholic monarchy
                            there, under vassalage to France, as Napoleon had done when he made Maximilian the
                            first King of Bavaria in 1805.
                            The separatist movement in the Rhineland went so far that some leading German
                            politicians came out in favour of it, suggesting that if the Rhineland were thus ceded it
                            might be possible for the German Republic to strike a bargain with the French in regard
                            to Reparations. But in Bavaria the movement went even farther. And it was more farreaching
                            in its implications; for, if an independent Catholic monarchy could be set up in
                            Bavaria, the next move would have been a union with Catholic German-Austria.
                            possibly under a Habsburg King. Thus a Catholic BLOC would have been created

                                IN PLACING before the reader this unabridged translation of Adolf Hitler's book,
                                MEIN KAMPF, I feel it my duty to call attention to certain historical facts which must
                                be borne in mind if the reader would form a fair judgment of what is written in this
                                extraordinary work.
                                The first volume of MEIN KAMPF was written while the author was imprisoned in a
                                Bavarian fortress. How did he get there and why? The answer to that question is
                                important, because the book deals with the events which brought the author into this
                                plight and because he wrote under the emotional stress caused by the historical
                                happenings of the time. It was the hour of Germany's deepest humiliation, somewhat
                                parallel to that of a little over a century before, when Napoleon had dismembered the
                                old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germany.
                                In the beginning of 1923 the French invaded Germany, occupied the Ruhr district and
                                seized several German towns in the Rhineland. This was a flagrant breach of
                                international law and was protested against by every section of British political opinion
                                at that time. The Germans could not effectively defend themselves, as they had been
                                already disarmed under the provisions of the Versailles Treaty. To make the situation
                                more fraught with disaster for Germany, and therefore more appalling in its prospect,
                                the French carried on an intensive propaganda for the separation of the Rhineland from
                                the German Republic and the establishment of an independent Rhenania. Money was
                                poured out lavishly to bribe agitators to carry on this work, and some of the most
                                insidious elements of the German population became active in the pay of the invader.
                                At the same time a vigorous movement was being carried on in Bavaria for the
                                secession of that country and the establishment of an independent Catholic monarchy
                                there, under vassalage to France, as Napoleon had done when he made Maximilian the
                                first King of Bavaria in 1805.
                                The separatist movement in the Rhineland went so far that some leading German
                                politicians came out in favour of it, suggesting that if the Rhineland were thus ceded it
                                might be possible for the German Republic to strike a bargain with the French in regard
                                to Reparations. But in Bavaria the movement went even farther. And it was more farreaching
                                in its implications; for, if an independent Catholic monarchy could be set up in
                                Bavaria, the next move would have been a union with Catholic German-Austria.
                                possibly under a Habsburg King. Thus a Catholic BLOC would have been created
